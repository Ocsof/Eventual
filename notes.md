# NOTES ABOUT THE CODE

## Component "SignUp"
Utilizzo della libreria popolare consigliata da React _formik_ (https://formik.org/docs/overview)

Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts:
* Getting values in and out of form state 
* Validation and error messages 
* Handling form submission
By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik will keep things organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze.

## React Router Dom 
Utilizzato react-router-dom v. 6.0 dove componente _Switch_ Ã¨ stato sostituito con componente _Routes_
